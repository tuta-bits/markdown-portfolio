ðŸ’– Building software solutions and maintaining computer systems as a *Computer Programmer* are two of my passions.<br>
While in college **(UpSkilled)**, I created software solutions for my projects that gave me the opportunity to thrive in the art and become quite comfortable with **C#** language manipulations.
Database design/maintenance *(My SQL & T-SQL)*, software management, unit testing and debugging, and network architecture are all relevant abilities I'll bring to the team.<br><br>
As a **Full-Stack Developer** âœ¨, I've mastered essential **Front-end** technologies like *HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript*, and knowledge of third-party libraries like *jQuery, LESS, Angular and ReactJS*.<br>
Furthermore, I've essential knowledge on working with *Github repositories, Github Website deployment and Bootstrap*.<br><br>
On the **Back-end side**, am quite conversant with Python Data Structures & Algorithms, Python Socket & Security Programming, Django Custom Applications, Django RET API and Node.js process managers etc.
